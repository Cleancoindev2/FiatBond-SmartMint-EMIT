# FiatBond-SmartMint ERC-721 Bond Self Lending Collatoralization Fiat Interface
This creates Bonds Loans to Yourself with your Fiat Collateral!  Bonds are backed by the promise of SmartMint to redeem the maturity % profit on the dates the bond maturity was agreed to.  The fiat will remain in the pool until the end of the Bond Loan.  When the Loan expires and no payback has occured the client keeps the Bond and the fiat pool is the Pool's profit for the full value of the bond + the 10% cost of origination.
